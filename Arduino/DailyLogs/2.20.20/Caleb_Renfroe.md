More research on the GPS. Next few weeks will mostly be research. Want to make sure I know every detail I can about theArduino parts and how they will interact together.

Drone successfully achieved flight this week! Dave was able to get it to liftoff and hover it around and moderately steer for a few minutes, before landing back down.
