Looked at basic overview research on AdaFruit Ultimate GPS Breakout module in terms of specs and functions. Did research on the AdaFruit GPS
module library to find out how to get data and parse it to get specific information such as latitude and longitude.

Additionally tested motors on drone to check if they are functioning correctly depending on the movement type. Did another test outdoors, found
that two weren't quite working as they should.
