Today we began research on the AdaFruit Ultimate GPS Breakout. I began research looking into the guide made by adarfruit, writing down what the pins do. Created a new markdown to track info on the GPS, and worked with Aaron filling it in with some initial info for now.

Other than Arduino, we also did a short flight test. It did not fly, and we are looking into it to fix it.
